#### JBrowse main configuration file

## uncomment the section below to customize this browser's title and description
# [aboutThisBrowser]
# title = <i>Oryza sativa</i>
# description = Browser for O. sativa transcripts and RNA-seq data,
#   produced by the Smith laboratory at Example State University.

## uncomment and edit the example below to configure a faceted track selector
[trackSelector]
type = Faceted
displayColumns =
   + Name
   + Product
   + Annotation
   + Pathway


 

## optionally sort the faceted track selector by column (use the names from displayColumns)
initialSortColumn=label
## optionally give different names to some of the data facets using renameFacets
# [trackSelector.renameFacets]
# submission = Submission ID
# developmental-stage = Conditions
# cell-line = Cell Line
# key = Dataset
# label = Track

## uncomment this section to get hierarchical trackselector options
# [trackSelector]
## optionally turn off sorting for the hierarchical track selector
# sortHierarchical = false
## set collapsed categories for the hierarchical track selector
# collapsedCategories = Reference sequence,Quantitative / XY Plot
## set category ordering in the hierarchical track selector
# categoryOrder = BAM, Transcripts, Quantitative/Density, VCF

## configure where to get metadata about tracks.  always indexes the
## `metadata` part of each track config, but this can be used to load
## additional metadata from CSV or JSON urls
[trackMetadata]
sources = data/modencode.2.csv
